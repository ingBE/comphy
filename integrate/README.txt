I have a k-grid set within hexagonal symmetry, is stored in the following files:

Kgrid_x.dat : grid along x-axis
Kgrid_y.dat : grid along y-axis
Curv_z.dat : z-values, 3 dimensional data with size (241,34), 241 is the data for selected 34 bands.


The Matlab program ‘PlotData.m’ will plot the data.
